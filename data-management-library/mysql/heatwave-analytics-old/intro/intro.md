## **Workshop Overview**

This workshop will walk you through the process to deploy and configure MySQL Database Service & HeatWave to run Analytics workloads in Oracle Cloud. 
 
HeatWave is a new, integrated, high-performance analytics engine for MySQL Database Service. HeatWave accelerates MySQL performance by 400X for analytics queries, scales out to thousands of cores, and is 2.7X faster at one-third the cost of Amazon Redshift. MySQL Database Service, with HeatWave, is the only service that enables database admins and app developers to run OLTP and OLAP workloads directly from their MySQL database, eliminating the need for complex, time-consuming, and expensive data movement and integration with a separate analytics database. The service is optimized for and exclusively available in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). For more information about HeatWave, check this **[Link!](https://www.oracle.com/ie/mysql/heatwave/)**
 
At the end of the workshop you will be able to run some queries on a sample dataset loaded into MySQL Database Service and compare the execution times with and without HeatWave. Prepare yourself to be surprised! 
 
Estimated Workshop Time: 100 minutes
